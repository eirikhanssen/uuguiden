00:00:03.014 --> 00:00:05.256
Good evening, good morning or good afternoon!

2
00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:11.143
Depending on when you're listening to my presentation.

3
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:16.100
First, let's talk about the topic which I've chosen.

4
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:22.186
It is somthing which has interested me a lot

5
00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.557
For several years.

6
00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:30.831
It's about supporting people who want to create accessible digital content.

7
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:36.371
The scope of this project is "in an educational context"

8
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.461
So, who are we talking about? Who's the target group?

9
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:49.229
This project, even if it's relevant for a lot of people

10
00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:54.642
The target group is teachers and other content creators

11
00:00:54.842 --> 00:01:03.114
Who create digital content which is intended to be used in higher education.

12
00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:07.330
So, what am I going to do in this project?

13
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.836
First, I am going to develop an interactive guide

14
00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:17.857
To help content creators create accessible digital content

15
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.829
And it also has to be universally designed

16
00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:27.271
Why is this important?

17
00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:31.514
Aren't there enough resources out there already?

18
00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:36.270
Well, the problem is, there are so many resources out there

19
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.829
You just don't know where to begin looking.

20
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:46.837
Another factor that many people I have talked to are stressing is that

21
00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:51.914
It's the time! You don't have... Do you have the time?

22
00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:56.314
To spend hours, looking at different guides 

23
00:01:56.514 --> 00:02:01.086
to figure out exactly what do you have to do

24
00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:06.700
to make this document, or this digital content accessible

25
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.129
this is a quote I actually heard from a teacher

26
00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.843
Something like "I am so stressed for time, just give me a list and show me how to do it!"

27
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.857
So, how will I try to solve this problem?

28
00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:26.814
My study uses a mixed methods approach

29
00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:30.593
We have one method for development

30
00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:35.271
and another method for evaluation

31
00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:40.300
Now I will talk about development methodology

32
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.327
From Human Centered Design we have chosen

33
00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:49.743
to use an iterative prototype development methodology

34
00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:52.529
This is quite common in Human Centered Design.

35
00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.814
The idea is that

36
00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.629
If you want to develop something for users

37
00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.643
you have to involve them from the beginning

38
00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:02.400
so how do you do this?

39
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.157
it's an iterative process

40
00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:07.157
you develop something small

41
00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:11.039
and you get some users to test it

42
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.371
and the users in this case are from the target group

43
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:18.043
which are university teachers and other staff

44
00:03:18.243 --> 00:03:20.761
so we get user feedback 

45
00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:25.657
from the first iteration of the prototype

46
00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:28.832
based on this feedback

47
00:03:29.032 --> 00:03:33.129
we decide on how to improve the prototype

48
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.771
for the next generation

49
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:41.771
so the iterative process continues for several generations

50
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.786
or we call it "iterations"

51
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.378
This is also part of the development methodology

52
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.698
There's something called

53
00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:59.943
low fidelity vs high fidelity prototypes

54
00:04:01.314 --> 00:04:04.629
low fidelity, we can also call it paper prototyping

55
00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.917
which means we can sketch out some ideas on paper

56
00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:12.885
all we need is paper, pen, maybe scissors

57
00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:17.260
and we can start brainstorming ideas

58
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.243
try to figure out what is this thing we're making

59
00:04:22.443 --> 00:04:23.793
what's it going to be like

60
00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:27.243
the advantage to using paper prototyping 

61
00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:29.243
or low fidelity prototyping

62
00:04:29.443 --> 00:04:35.610
is that you can generate a lot of ideas quite quickly 

63
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.533
and not a lot of time is invested 

64
00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:44.955
so it's easy to scrap some bad ideas and try out some new ideas

65
00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:59.553
when we reach a stage that the design has stabilized a little bit

66
00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:04.171
then we can move on to high fidelity prototyping

67
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:06.799
these are more time consuming

68
00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:15.671
and they can be interactive and quite close to the final product or prototype

69
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:23.053
in this case I'm developing an interactive guide in the form of a webpage

70
00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:30.986
so, in the low fidelity stage, which I actually did before involving users

71
00:05:31.186 --> 00:05:33.778
I used paper and pen

72
00:05:33.978 --> 00:05:43.114
and then with user feedback I was working in the high fidelity prototyping stage

73
00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:54.114
after developing the final prototype...

74
00:05:54.314 --> 00:05:59.500
you know, you can go on forever to improve a prototype

75
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.140
but at some time, at some point, we just have to stop and evaluate it

76
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.345
so how do we evaluate this interactive guide?

77
00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:18.987
well, we choose some participants

78
00:06:19.187 --> 00:06:27.042
and either, we can ask them to present some documents they have made before

79
00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:33.728
or I will do a heuristic review of these documents

80
00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:39.314
this means that I will have a checklist of different things I'm looking for

81
00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:44.903
different accessibility mistakes I will be looking for in these documents

82
00:06:45.103 --> 00:06:55.071
and then the participant can have access to this guide and try to create some new documents

83
00:06:55.271 --> 00:07:05.647
and I can also do a heuristic review of the documents they are making when they have access to this guide

84
00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:10.843
then I can compare before and after (having access to the interactive guide)

85
00:07:11.043 --> 00:07:15.751
what kind of accessibility mistakes have been made

86
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:22.350
we also collect data qualitatively

87
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.147
by user observation which is similar to user testing

88
00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:33.357
when we have a participant who is creating some digital content 

89
00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:36.420
while using the interactive guide 

90
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.732
which is supposed to help them create accessible content

91
00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:45.529
then I will just be observing and making notes

92
00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:54.286
then after, we will have the users or participants fill out something called

93
00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:58.039
the system usability scale, which is a lickert scale

94
00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:01.726
It will ask different questions about how usable this guide is

95
00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:09.955
and finally, we will interview the participants using semi structured interviews

96
00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:18.271
so, what are the preliminary results

97
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:23.255
well some of the results are the feedback I have already received 

98
00:08:23.455 --> 00:08:26.986
some of the types of feedback received 

99
00:08:27.186 --> 00:08:34.161
is about the structure of the guide, also naming of things, language and grammar

100
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:43.573
several users commented that they were looking forward to 

101
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:49.211
specific instructions on different software they would be using

102
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:54.463
also the guide has some filtering which needs to be fixed

103
00:08:54.663 --> 00:09:02.429
there are different kinds of parameters that will taylor the guide to the user's needs

104
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:08.428
so if you're working with video, you will have an interactive guide

105
00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:12.622
which will tell you about how to make an accessible video

106
00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:15.683
if your'e working with a document, say in Word

107
00:09:15.883 --> 00:09:20.000
then you will have a taylored guide which will give you 

108
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.671
the tips you need when working with documents in Word

109
00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:25.686
and also what kind of content you have there

110
00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:29.950
if you have images, then you can get image specific feedback

111
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:36.104
so another preliminary result is the result of

112
00:09:36.304 --> 00:09:44.002
implementing the feedback from round 1 actually

113
00:09:44.202 --> 00:09:49.909
This is the beginning, the top of the webpage

114
00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:55.517
before considering the second round of feedback

115
00:09:55.629 --> 00:10:02.486
So I think that will be all for this presentation

116
00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:09.984
I will be seeing you later!
