<p><strong>Transcript of the method presentation</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>
Good evening, good morning or good afternoon!
Depending on when you're listening to my presentation.
</p>
<p>
First, let's talk about the topic which I've chosen.
It is somthing which has interested me a lot For several years.
It's about supporting people who want to create accessible digital content.
The scope of this project is "in an educational context".
</p>
<p>
So, who are we talking about? Who's the target group?.
This project, even if it's relevant for a lot of people, the target group is teachers and other content creators who create digital content which is intended to be used in higher education.
</p>
<p>
So, what am I going to do in this project?
First, I am going to develop an interactive guide to help content creators create accessible digital content.
And it also has to be universally designed.
</p>
<p>
Why is this important?
Aren't there enough resources out there already?
Well, the problem is, there are so many resources out there, you just don't know where to begin looking.
Another factor that many people I have talked to are stressing is that, It's the time! You don't have... Do you have the time to spend hours, looking at different guides 
to figure out exactly what do you have to do to make this document, or this digital content accessible?
This is a quote I actually heard from a teacher. Something like "I am so stressed for time, just give me a list and show me how to do it!"
</p>
<p>
So, how will I try to solve this problem? My study uses a mixed methods approach.
We have one method for development and another method for evaluation.
</p>
<p>
Now I will talk about development methodology.
From Human Centered Design we have chosen to use an iterative prototype development methodology.
This is quite common in Human Centered Design.
The idea is that if you want to develop something for users, you have to involve them from the beginning
So how do you do this?
it's an iterative process. You develop something small and you get some users to test it.
And the users in this case are from the target group which are university teachers and other staff (in higher education).
So we get user feedback from the first iteration of the prototype.
Based on this feedback we decide on how to improve the prototype for the next generation.
So the iterative process continues for several generations, or we call it "iterations".
</p>

<p>
This is also part of the development methodology.
There's something called low fidelity vs high fidelity prototypes.
Low fidelity -we can also call it paper prototyping, which means we can sketch out some ideas on paper.
All we need is paper, pen, maybe scissors and we can start brainstorming ideas.
Try to figure out what is this thing we're making, what's it going to be like.
The advantage to using paper prototyping or low fidelity prototyping is that you can generate a lot of ideas quite quickly  and not a lot of time is invested .
So it's easy to scrap some bad ideas and try out some new ideas.
When we reach a stage that the design has stabilized a little bit, then we can move on to high fidelity prototyping.
These are more time consuming and they can be interactive and quite close to the final product or prototype.
In this case I'm developing an interactive guide in the form of a webpage.
So, in the low fidelity stage, which I actually did before involving users, I used paper and pen.
And then with user feedback I was working in the high fidelity prototyping stage.
After developing the final prototype...
</p>

<p>
You know, you can go on forever to improve a prototype, but at some time, at some point, we just have to stop and evaluate it.
So how do we evaluate this interactive guide?
Well, we choose some participants and either, we can ask them to present some documents they have made before, or I will do a heuristic review of these documents.
This means that I will have a checklist of different things I'm looking for.
Different accessibility mistakes I will be looking for in these documents.
And then the participant can have access to this guide and try to create some new documents.
And I can also do a heuristic review of the documents they are making when they have access to this guide, then I can compare before and after (having access to the interactive guide).
What kind of accessibility mistakes have been made?
</p>

<p>
We also collect data qualitatively by user observation which is similar to user testing.
When we have a participant who is creating some digital content while using the interactive guide which is supposed to help them create accessible content, then I will just be observing and making notes.
Then after, we will have the users or participants fill out something called the system usability scale, which is a lickert scale.
It will ask different questions about how usable this guide is.
And finally, we will interview the participants using semi structured interviews.
</p>

<p>
So, what are the preliminary results
Well some of the results are the feedback I have already received.
Some of the types of feedback received is about the structure of the guide, also naming of things, language and grammar.
Several users commented that they were looking forward to specific instructions on different software they would be using.
Also the guide has some filtering which needs to be fixed.
There are different kinds of parameters that will taylor the guide to the user's needs.
So if you're working with video, you will have an interactive guide which will tell you about how to make an accessible video.
If your'e working with a document, say in Word, then you will have a taylored guide which will give you the tips you need when working with documents in Word.
And also what kind of content you have there. If you have images, then you can get image specific feedback.
So another preliminary result is the result of implementing the feedback from round 1 actually.
</p>
<p>
This is the beginning, the top of the webpage before considering the second round of feedback.
So I think that will be all for this presentation.
I will be seeing you later!
